# FoodClassifier
A Machine Learning model based on PyTorch library of python for classifying an image of food into one of the two categories , either samosa or churros.

This project implements a convolutional neural network (CNN) using PyTorch to classify images of food items into two classes. The model is trained on a dataset containing images of the two food classes and achieves high accuracy in distinguishing between them.
